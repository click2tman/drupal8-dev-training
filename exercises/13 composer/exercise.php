// ==== Step 1 ====
// Use composer to load the SimpleHtmlDom library.
// - Find SimpleHtmlDom library on internet.
// - Check at packagist.org if this library is available
// - Add a composer.json file in the module directory. Include at least 'name'
//   and 'required'. See https://packagist.org/ for examples.
// - Install the library using "composer require ...". If you have installed
//   Drupal with console, run composer require from the project root directory.
//   Otherwise run composer require from the module directory.
// - Check that the vendor directory now contains the SimpleHtmlDom library.
